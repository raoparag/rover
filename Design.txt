Design Considerations
- build as a Spring boot microservice
- should it have an Restful API or command line only?

APIs
- create and move multiple rovers
    api - /rover
    params - rover[] - {roverId, position(x,y,facing), command}
    response - list of rovers with their position
- command line - java –cp target com.test.MarsRoverApp “3,4,N” “f,f,r,f,f”

Entity
- Position
    x, y, facing
- Rover
    roverId, position

Repository
- Rover Repository
    maintain List/map of Rovers

Class Structure
- RoverController - handles API requests and responses
- RoverService - holds business logic to move the rover
- Position & Rover - Pojos for entities
- RoverRequest - to hold API request

Main Logic
- execute one command at a time for each rover
- when executing the command do the below steps
    - get the new position of the rover after the command is applied
    - check for collisions with the existing rovers
    - if no collisions, update the current rover's position
    - repeat for each rover, each command

Validations
- multiple rovers present at the same location in the input
- invalid commands
- invalid input format
